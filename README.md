# Decoder-Ring
This project was designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms. 
I was also able to test my ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test my algorithms. 
Main topics accomplished:
- Writing a series of unit tests using Mocha and Chai
- Using different expect() methods to test your code
